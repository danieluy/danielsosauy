# www.danielsosa.uy v3
In this repository I'm developing the third version my own website, making it accessible and open source in every aspect.

## Development
```bash
# run
$ npm start
```

## Deploy
```bash
# run
$ npm run deploy
```
> Note: the index.html file get renamed as 404.html so GitHub pages fallsback to it on subroutes. This of course means the whole site is a awfull 404 Not found error.
