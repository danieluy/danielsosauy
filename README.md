# www.danielsosa.uy v3
In this repository I'm developing the third version my own website, making it accessible and open source in every aspect.

[Currently testing on Github Pages](http://test.danielsosa.uy)

## Development
```bash
# run
$ npm start
```

## Deploy
```bash
# run
$ npm run build
# Upload dist/ content to https://github.com/danieluy/danieluy.github.io
```
> Note: the index.html file gets renamed as 404.html so GitHub pages fallback to it on subroutes. This of course means the whole site is a awfull 404 Not found error.
