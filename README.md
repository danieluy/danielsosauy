# [danielsosa.uy](http://danielsosa.uy) v3
In this repository I'm developing the third version my personal website, making it accessible and open source in every aspect.

## Development
```bash
# run
$ npm start
```

## Deploy
```bash
# run
$ npm run build
# Upload dist/ content to https://github.com/danieluy/danieluy.github.io
```
> Note: the index.html file gets copied as 404.html so GitHub pages fallback to it on subroutes. This of course means the whole site is a awfull "404 Not found" error (except when loading /). 🤷🏽‍♂️
